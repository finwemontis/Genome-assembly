# Assembling the genome
canu code.
We are assembleling a genome with fair coverage ~x30, and need 

# refine the genome using pilon

# Aligning .fastq reads to genome
bwa-mem code

# SNPs and Indel detection
Freebayes & Platypus code

# QC of SNPs
vcftools

# Population structure
fastSTRUCTURE and PLINK code
